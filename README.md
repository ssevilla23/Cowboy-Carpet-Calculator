# ðŸ¤  Cowboy Carpet Calculator

The Cowboy Carpet Calculator is a website created for a fictional carpet installation company. It offers a calculator that helps users determine how much carpet they need to purchase based on the room dimensions they provide.

For this academic project, I was responsible for developing the functionality of the calculator using JavaScript:

+ **User input**: Users can enter the width and length in feet for up to two rooms.
+ **Calculation**: The calculator will then compute and display the total amount of carpet (in square feet) needed to install in their chosen room(s).
